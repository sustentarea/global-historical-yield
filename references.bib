  abstract = {The Global Dataset of Historical Yield (GDHYv1.2+v1.3) offers annual time series data of 0.5-degree grid-cell yield estimates of major crops worldwide for the period 1981-2016. The crops considered in this dataset are maize, rice, wheat and soybean. The unit of yield data is t/ha. The grd-cell yield data were estimated using the satellite-derived crop-specific vegetation index and FAO-reported country yield statistics. Maize and rice have the data for each of two growing seasons (major/secondary). "Winter" and "spring" are used as the growing season categories for wheat. Only "major" growing season is available for soybean. These growing season categories are based on Sacks et al. (2010, doi:10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00551.x). The geographic distribution of harvested area changes with time in reality, but we used the time-constant data in 2000 (Monfreda et al., 2008, doi:10.1029/2007GB002947). Many missing values are found in the first (1981) and last (2016) years because grid-cell yields are not estimated for these years when growing season spans two calendar years. The data for the period 1981-2010 are the same with the version 1.2 (doi:10.20783/DIAS.528). For the period 2011-2016, a newly created version 1.3 using the satellite products that are different with earlier versions was alighned to ensure the continuity of yield time series. This version is therefore called "the alighned version v1.2+v1.3".},

  abstract = {Knowing the historical yield patterns of major commodity crops, including the trends and interannual variability, is crucial for understanding the current status, potential and risks in food production in the face of the growing demand for food and climate change. We updated the global dataset of historical yields for major crops (GDHY), which is a hybrid of agricultural census statistics and satellite remote sensing, to cover the 36-year period from 1981 to 2016, with a spatial resolution of 0.5°. Four major crops were considered: maize, rice, wheat and soybean. The updated version 1.3 was developed and then aligned with the earlier version 1.2 to ensure the continuity of the yield time series. Comparisons with different global yield datasets and published results demonstrate that the GDHY-aligned version v1.2\,+\,v1.3 dataset is a valuable source of information on global yields. The aligned version dataset enables users to employ an increased number of yield samples for their analyses, which ultimately increases the confidence in their findings.},
